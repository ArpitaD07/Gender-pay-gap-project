# Gender-pay-gap-project

The aim of the project is to utilize the learnings from the IBM Data Analytics course. The data used for this project was acquired from the glass door dataset for analysing gender pay gap by different job titles. In this project, I have conducted data analysis and visualization with the help of IBM Cognos Analytics and Python coding. 

The gender pay gap is reported as six metrics or analytics
1. mean gender pay gap
2. median gender pay gap 
3. mean bonus gender pay gap 
4. median bonus gender pay gap 
5. proportion of males and females receiving a bonus payment
6. proportion of males and females in each quartile band

All the employees in the data have received bonus, therefore the fifth metric has not been measured.
